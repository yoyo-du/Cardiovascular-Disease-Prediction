# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
**STA 542 Categorical Data Analysis Methods Final Project**

We were interested in examining the associations between some factors (smoking, alcohol, and physical activity) and cardiovascular disease. We also did an exploratory analysis to explore the effects of some other factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, glucose intolerance, etc. on cardiovascular disease. 

Contingency tables and chi-square test were applied to explore the associations between categorical variables, which are smoke and cardio, alcohol and cardio, and physical activity and cardio. 

Finally, a multiple logistic regression model was fit to predict whether or not a person had cardiovascular disease based on the selected variables. The performance of the prediction was evaluated by ROC curve and percentage of accurate predictions.  

The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset
